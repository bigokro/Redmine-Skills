OVERVIEW

The Skills plugin adds the concept of required skills to the Redmine platform.
Issues can be configured to require a specific set of skills (e.g. "JQuery", "Struts").
Skills also include varying levels of knowledge (e.g. Level 1 - Beginner; Level 5 - Master)
that may be required to successfully resolve/complete an issue. Redmine users can then be associated 
with skills and appropriate skill levels. If a user does not possess the required skills, then the 
plugin can prevent them from being assigned to the issue.
